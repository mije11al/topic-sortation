# Topic sortation for political topics

These scripts sort Facebook text data from Attention trigger into topics.

emner.py uses keywords to sort through text,
and partition them into topics. nested-topics.py sorts the data into a nested 
structure, with a qualitatively determined hierarchy, that is located the key_for_nested_topics folder, in the file nested.xlsx
